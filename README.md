# DesignPattern

## Six Design Principles

* `Open Close Principle.`  
  _Simply, open to extend,close to modify._
* `Liskov Substitution Principle.`  
_Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP) is a extension of open-close principle.
Making proper abstraction is the key of principle open-close._
* `Dependence Inversion Principle.`  
_Basis of open-close principle. Interface oriented programming, dependent on abstraction rather than specific class,object._
* `Interface Segregation Principle.`  
_It will be better by using mutiple segregated interface than by using a single interface because of its lower degree of coupling._
* `Demeter Principle.`  
_the less one entity is conscious of the relationship between itself and others, the more independent system module will be._
* `Composite/Aggregate Reuse Principle.`  
*it will be helpful by using Composite/Aggregate,rather than 'extends'*
