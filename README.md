# DesignPattern

## Six Design Principles

* `Open Close Principle.`
Simply, open to extend,close to modify.
* `Liskov Substitution Principle.`
Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP) is a extension of open-close principle.
Making proper abstraction is the key of principle open-close.
* `Dependence Inversion Principle.`
Basis of open-close principle. Interface oriented programming, dependent on abstraction rather than specific class,object.
* `Interface Segregation Principle.`
It will be better by using mutiple segregated interface than by using a single interface because of its lower degree of coupling
* `Demeter Principle.` the less one entity is conscious of the relationship between itself and others, the more independent system module will be.
* `Composite/Aggregate Reuse Principle.` it will be helpful by using Composite/Aggregate,rather than 'extends'
