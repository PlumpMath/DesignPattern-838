# DesignPattern

Six Design Principles.
1 Open Close Principle.
Simply, open to extend,close to modify.
2 Liskov Substitution Principle.
Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP) is a extension of open-close principle.
Making proper abstraction is the key of principle open-close.
3 Dependence Inversion Principle.
Basis of open-close principle. Interface oriented programming, dependent on abstraction rather than specific class,object.
4 Interface Segregation Principle
It will be better by using mutiple segregated interface than by using a single interface because of its lower degree of coupling

23 kinds of Design Pattern in this project based on the principles of design.
